Not only the fans but also the players, tournament conducting authorities, sponsors, franchises owing the teams participating in the sporting events, top brands and news organizations are also members of these sites and share the updates almost continuously.
Even though the underlying structure of the Facebook and Twitter is different, they share the same idea of containing the opinions of their users on the teams, players or events going on in the world of sports.
We attempted to cluster the data from the two social network websites and perform a combined analysis on the clustered datasets to estimate the sentiments of the topic solely based on the user interest.
